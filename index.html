<p>honestly, when rafael nadal started playing tennis, i really wasn&rsquo;t a fan of his, it wasn&rsquo;t that i hated watching him play or his looks, i guess he didn&rsquo;t really have any extraordinary skills it seemed at the time, he came out of clay courts, like many other spanish players and played as a counter puncher which is also quite typical of clay court specialists, not very fun to watch in my humble opinion, baseline rallies would easily go 20-30 strokes a point, it seemed the point was just to hit the ball back and force the other player to make a mistake as opposed to hitting clean winners.  there were other spanish players of note that excelled on clay courts, i&rsquo;m looking at you sergei bruguera and albert costa, but couldn&rsquo;t win a thing on the faster surfaces like hard and grass courts.  later on nadal would prove that he wasn&rsquo;t just a clay courts specialist, he would win on all other surfaces and consistently beat the top players.  what&rsquo;s not to like about someone who plays with guts, never gives up on a point, runs down almost every ball?  rafael was always very athletic, had both endurance and bursty speed, and i don&rsquo;t think any other tennis player can compare in terms of biceps size.  but he seemed a little bit different from your ideal tennis player with the long hair, doorags, tank tops, flashy colors, fiery attitude, unconventional strokes, wicked left handed spin, he wasn&rsquo;t your stereotypical tennis player of any time really.  honestly, his whirling forehand almost seems reminiscent of those spanish bull fighters whirling their capes away from charging bulls, the follow through literally goes over his head and whips at the end to the back of the head!</p>

<p><img src="https://tennishead.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Rafael-Nadal-Monte-Carlo.jpg" alt="clay court specialist" /></p>

<p>i had to think on this for a long time, on why i wasn&rsquo;t a rafa guy, and i came to the conclusion that the main factor was probably roger federer, how could you like anyone but federer?  federer was this clean cut swiss with precision like a surgeon, he would disect opponents and break them down with ease, his all court style of tennis was like reading poetry when watching him, serve and volley, baseline rallies, he had it all.  but still, nadal took federer on many surfaces, wimbledon, us and australian opens, and of course trounced federer on clay.</p>

<p>but over time, i have grown to really like nadal and appreciate his accomplishments, even though he is probably one of the most unconventional players even more so than andre agassi (don&rsquo;t get me started with that crucifix earing on his left ear, goatee, and literally flaming compression shorts), but nadal&rsquo;s tenacity and spirit, even at age 36, after getting coronavirus and having foot surgery only a few months before the australian open, was able to overcome 5 and half hours of play against an up and coming 26 year old star to win his 21st grand slam tournament which is more than djokovic and federer, that makes rafa truly the goat, the greatest of all time.  on top of that he had to also overcome several major surgeries over his career, for some time you&rsquo;d only hear about federer and djokovic finals, there was no mention of nadal, but he hung in there and he made his comeback.  and if you watched today&rsquo;s championship game you&rsquo;d see that rafa had added many things to his arsenal, he&rsquo;s no longer the same counter-puncher from his early years, he hits winners with his forehand and backhand quite frequently, he comes to the net to volley, he&rsquo;s a more all around player, but most importantly, he&rsquo;s still got the guts from years ago that lets him fight through all the adversity.</p>

<p>i appreciate this about him and he manages to do this like any other normal guy, going to work everyday, putting in his time, match after match, stroke after stroke, just a really humble chap.  so with that, my congratulations to the champion of champions, rafael nadal you are the goat of tennis!</p>

<p>microsoft has been on a resurgence lately, not just from a stock perspective, but also from a mindshare perspective, the company has been growing quickly in terms of its overall business (traditional software, azure cloud, gaming, etc), people are starting to believe in microsoft as a leading innovator especially since that monkey ballmer left.  and for a long time you didn&rsquo;t hear about any issues with their windows operating system as windows 10 has been a seeming success, could be that the earlier versions of windows 10 had issues, but i only started using windows 10 recently.  however, windows 10 certainly can&rsquo;t be comparable to the windows vista days, that was one of microsoft&rsquo;s biggest disasters.  but low and behold, microsoft has regained its footing as kings of incompetence with their latest operating system, windows 11!  in very odd fashion, windows 11 was rolled out to limited users, first it came bundled with new hardware and only a limited number people with old hardware were able to update, i assume they were shaking out the bugs and didn&rsquo;t want it to impact too many people hence the slow roll out, it&rsquo;s probably like the equivalent of an alpha launch.  this all started back in october last year, at that time it wasn&rsquo;t made available to me, but just recently i was added to the list and my laptop met the requirements for install so i upgraded.  windows 11 has very strict requirements for tpm and secure boot, without this, you will not be able to install.  my desktop had this issue and i&rsquo;m still not sure if i need to re-install from scratch or that an update is possible.</p>

<p>however, after using windows 11 for a few days, i have found that it is completely unstable, i performed an update instead of a clean install, and here are some of the issues that i&rsquo;ve had to deal with: docker being unable to start, wireguard getting in a non-stop spin trying to activate a connection, finger print reader not reading (this happens consistently after the first successful read, all subsequent reads fail), windows installer locking up, virtual box locking up, overheating while the lid is closed and in sleep mode, there have been several instances where i wasn&rsquo;t even able to bring up the task manager to kill chrome browser and if i could bring up the task manager, end task would have absolutely no response, the only way to resolve the issue was to reboot the machine, but the reboot sometimes gets stalled where i needed to hard power off the machine, this has been a total nightmare and makes windows 11 totally unusable.  i have kept all drivers, bios/firmware, and patches up to date, i would strongly suggest not installing windows 11 at this point in time, don&rsquo;t kid yourself, it takes me back to the days of windows 95 where if you&rsquo;re heavily using your computer, you&rsquo;d need to reboot multiple times a day to make the basics work.  this is completely unacceptable even if windows 11 is a free upgrade.  i am more afraid of rolling back to windows 10, so i&rsquo;ll keep windows 11 for now, but this has been a productivity nightmare.  seems that the infallible satya is not really capable of pulling microsoft out of the broken software mire, have you no shame man?  this shows direct incompetence even if azure is blowing the roof off in terms of revenue!  and for the record, i&rsquo;m an investor in microsoft.  what i&rsquo;ve decided to do is install ubuntu 20.04 lts desktop as a dual boot option, if it proves worthy, i may even just do a clean install with ubuntu alone, but i feel bad not having recouped my costs for a windows 10 license (this you still have to pay for).</p>
