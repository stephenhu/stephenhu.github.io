<p><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2022/0227/r980029_1023x682_3-2.jpg" alt="Embiid and Harden Era" /></p>

<p>Right before the trade deadline for the 2021-22 NBA season, the Sixers made a pretty significant trade with the Nets to land superstar James Harden.  The trade primarily involved swapping disgruntled stars Ben Simmons for Harden and ended a long winded saga that started right after the Sixers loss in the seventh game of the 2020-21 playoffs to eventual champions Milwaukee.  Simmons was lambasted for foregoing an easy dunk with the lead late in the do or die game, game seven, due to his hesitancy to get to the foul line.  Simmons throughout his career has been reluctant to shoot anything over 5-6 feet which makes his entire game more like that of a center and this causes major problems and deficiencies to the Sixers offense because Embiid is the center.  The trade also involved sending Seth Curry, Andre Drummond, and two first round draft picks to Brooklyn, Philly added veteran Paul Millsap in addition to Harden.</p>

<h2>Trade Analysis</h2>

<p>So who got the better end of the trade, I think Simmons has a lot of upside, he&rsquo;s an athletic close to seven footer that can handle the ball and pass with the best of them.  In the paint coupled with his speed and size, he can easily convert high percentage dunks and layups, he&rsquo;s not bad with floaters and I think he even developed a bit of a hook shot.  Will he develop his shooting range over time, probably, but the fact that he&rsquo;s played so many seasons already without making many attempts tells me something&rsquo;s wrong mentally.  What&rsquo;s the worst that can happen if you shoot a lot and miss, a horrible shooting percentage, fans and media gripe (they already were without him shooting), I don&rsquo;t mean for Simmons to take poorly contested shots from strange positions, but if you&rsquo;re wide open and you pass up shots, you&rsquo;re not playing the game correctly.  Basketball is a team sport, everyone has a role to play and if you don&rsquo;t shoot, you end up hurting your teammates, everyone just ends up double teaming someone else or packing the paint as we call it, leaving this person that won&rsquo;t shoot wide open.  I find Simmons&rsquo; logic extremely misinformed, he feels that he will hurt the team by taking mid range shots and missing, yes there are cases of this because a missed jump shot typically means the ball&rsquo;s going to bounce farther and faster off the rim in the opposite direction which could lead to fast breaks, but this typically has to do with poorly contested shots where a player is having to shoot over the outstretched arms of three defenders while doing a turn around fade away from 20 feet, nobody&rsquo;s asking Simmons to do this.   Also on shooting mid range jumpers, since teammates are getting themselves in position to receive a pass on offense, their backs are against the basket which means the defenders are in a much better position to get a rebound, but there are such things like offensive rebounds, shots that hit the rim often times bounce right back to the shooter, so typically basketball coaches will teach you to get ready for the rebound after a missed shot, not sulk and feel bad for missing.  If you start to shoot, a defender&rsquo;s first instinct is to try and hinder your shot, it takes a high level of mental preparation as a defender to say to yourself, &ldquo;this is Ben Simmons, he isn&rsquo;t going to shoot, just sit back in the paint and wait for the pass or rebound&rdquo;, often times there&rsquo;s not enough time to make that mental decision so it all goes down to reflexes.  Anyway, by shooting when you have a wide open shot, you pull defenders off your teammates, open more lanes for passing, and the offense flows better, guaranteed.  Shoot enough of these and they&rsquo;ll start to fall down eventually.</p>

<p>The Nets have all sorts of shooters, Irving, Durant, they can shoot from range or take the ball to the hole so having a third shooter doesn&rsquo;t really hurt like in the case of having Harden, but the higher priority is defense and passing, this is where Simmons shines.  This dynamic will be better for Simmons because unlike Embiid who likes to stay low in the paint, Durant and Irving will draw defenders out of the paint leaving backdoor cuts open where Simmons can do his best which is dunking.  He&rsquo;s also got long arms which is a nightmare for shooters from a defensive perspective.  So from a fit, this is quite nice for the Nets, but I don&rsquo;t think this trade puts the Nets into championship contention, they&rsquo;re still missing something, a third player like a wing player that can shoot corner three&rsquo;s or slash and dunk on opponents.</p>

<p>The Sixers are already in contention for the top of the Eastern Conference, they remove someone that was costing them a fortune, but not even playing a single game this season and get a superstar that can shoot the ball better than anyone else on the team.  James Harden is the real deal, he is easily one of the top offensive players in the league, right in the conversation with Durant, Curry, Thompson, Leonard, James, Davis, there is a supreme difference in the comparison of Harden and Simmons from an absolute value perspective, but the fit for the Sixers is even better, Harden adds that complementary piece to Philly, he will spread the floor and cause less pressure on Embiid.  In consolation, Harden has never played with any center of Embiid&rsquo;s ability, typically the centers that have played with Harden like Kendrik Perkins and Clint Capella have been pick and roll dunking machines, they set screens for Harden to do his magic and then roll to the rim for a chance at an alley-oop or put back dunk, must of the work is more on setting picks.  None of those two centers could shoot the ball, create offense on their own, or dribble drive finishing with a euro-step.  And Harden, though vastly improved over previous seasons, doesn&rsquo;t do a great job on defense.</p>

<p>From a trade perspective, I think the amount of players and picks being exchanged shows fairly the value of Harden over Simmons, Harden was starting to gripe about his role at the Nets towards the end and he has an extension coming up in the 2022-23 season which means he could leave without Brooklyn getting anything from it, so this was a pretty well executed trade by Sean Marks.  Daryl Morey didn&rsquo;t fair badly either, he made a great trade and sacrificed some of the future, but Harden, if healthy, can provide a few good years and there are exciting players like Tyrese Maxey and Matisse Thybulle that provide energy and youth for the future.  All in all, I don&rsquo;t think this trade puts the Sixers easily in the title contention, typically there needs to be a triumvirate to take it all the way, Golden State&rsquo;s Curry, Thompson, Green, Milwaukee&rsquo;s Antetokounmpo, Middleton, Tucker, Toronto&rsquo;s Leonard, Siakam, and Lowry, the Laker&rsquo;s James, Davis, and Rondo, I don&rsquo;t see that third piece just yet.  Tobias Harris is too inconsistent and more of a third rung type player, Maxey while good, is too inexperienced, Millsap is a bench player winding down his career, in his heyday at Atlanta or even with the Nuggets he was a solid player, but now he&rsquo;s much older, his body&rsquo;s broken down a bit, so the Sixers don&rsquo;t have a third star yet.  And you look at their bench, Korkmaz, Milton, Niang, Green, Cauley-Stein, there&rsquo;s basically no backup point guard, Korkmaz is an inconsistent shooter after all these years, he is prone to defensive lapses, and often turns the ball over.  From all the bench players, Danny Green has some experience, but he&rsquo;s also getting old like Millsap, so cannot provide that energy needed for a strong third.</p>

<p>My guess is that this year Philly doesn&rsquo;t win it all, they&rsquo;ve still got some significant gaps in their team roster though this change does improve their chances.  My picks for this year, obviously if there are no significant injuries, are either Milwaukee, Miami, or Golden State in that order of likelyhood.  Milwaukee even though losing one of my favorite players in Donte DiVincenzo and P.J. Tucker from the championship squad, added Jrue Holiday, and they still have a pretty deep bench.  Golden State has the championship pedigree, but Thompson is probably 80-85% of his old self, Green has been injury ridden the past few years, and Curry is having to shoulder much more than usual with his aging body.  Miami, on the other hand, has added some significant pieces, P.J. Tucker, Lowry (albeit aging), Oladipo, Markieff Morris, and have managed to keep most of their core, Adebayo, Robinson, Herro, and Butler.</p>

<p>To me, this year is a step up for Philly, though the real opportunity is next year, if they can stay healthy and continue to improve the roster, they might be in the championship conversation for the next two years.</p>

<p>for the longest time, <em>longest</em> defined as since 2006 (16 years!), i had basically switched off of using windows for work and home as my main operating system.  apple had switched to intel processors by then and my employers had provided apple hardware as an option at that point.  there wasn&rsquo;t really any software that i couldn&rsquo;t run on mac os x so the timing was right to switch.  additionally, linux was getting more stable for desktops and laptops, and there were virtualization technologies like vmware fusion which made mac a great environment for development and normal usage.</p>

<p>windows xp came out around 2005 and it was only because work provided me with a dell laptop that i used this.  it wasn&rsquo;t bad relatively speaking, xp was a huge leap forward for microsoft compared to windows 2000 and windows 98, but i also remember there being a lot of viruses that would be unleashed on windows xp.  and microsoft had and still has to this day this way of forcing incompatibility on the world, like the fact that it uses newlines and carriage returns instead of just newlines, file paths use a backslash instead of a forward slash, internet explorer had all sorts of nuances that annoyed me like standard html tags that worked in every other browser except internet explorer.</p>

<p>it wasn&rsquo;t until last year that i had started to move back towards using windows and it was more out of necessity.  i was quite pleased with mac os x&rsquo;s stability and functionality, but i had joined a gaming startup and for the gaming world, windows is still king.  for example, if you search for linux games on steam and then do the same search for windows games, you&rsquo;ll find at least a 4-10x difference in numbers.  games on mac os x are a little bit more numerous than linux, but not by much.  and it totally makes sense, most people aren&rsquo;t running linux on their home desktops and laptops, it&rsquo;s most likely either windows or mac os x, so gaming companies cater to these platforms.  it&rsquo;s not terribly much work to port from these platforms, i guess it depends on which frameworks and technologies you use for your games, but there&rsquo;s cost associated with porting which is mostly testing for various platforms.  additionally, mobile had gotten so interesting which probably superceded linux and mac os x in terms of testing priority.</p>

<p>i think mac os x also had this thing with gpu drivers being a pain to develop for, i don&rsquo;t remember the particulars, but seem to recall that mac os x kernel that prevented you from entirely using nvidia&rsquo;s gpu drivers, so apple had to also do some updates to the bsd kernel as well.  i don&rsquo;t know if it was a license issue or intellectual property issue or what, i mean, mac hardware typically is pretty limited, you can&rsquo;t diy and add any gpu that you want.  so i think this has been what has made gaming on windows thrive.  there&rsquo;s probably a large contingency of overclockers and diy&rsquo;ers that want to customize their rigs with rgb lights, the latest and greatest gpu&rsquo;s, coolers, and gaming really requires every bit of performance that you can squeeze out.</p>

<p>and not to mention, epic games has been in a lawsuit with apple about the app store recently which means my favorite game of all time, fortnite, cannot be played on mac os x, they stopped updating the mac os x version for months.</p>

<p>windows is the king of gaming platforms for pc.  windows on laptops also have a dominant position for many of the same reasons as desktop, but here i wanted to speak my peace about gaming on laptops in general.  laptops do not have very effective cooling mechanisms, the use case for laptops is typically for portability, bring it with you on the subway, to starbucks, to the beach, so naturally space is limited, that forces you to use smaller fans, and everyone knows that smaller fans means that the fan noise will be obnoxiously louder than larger fans like the ones in your desktop.  the fact that the keyboard is embedded in this piece of machinery, the laptop, means that much of the heat from the cpu, gpu, hard drive, and memory is going to get absorbed directly into the keyboard.  water cooling is relatively mainstream now, but have you seen the size of the pump that needs to get fitted into a desktop to circulate water around a desktop?  that&rsquo;s not going to fit into a laptop at least at this point in time.  (almost seems like a wonderful business opportunity to build water cooling for laptops).</p>

<p>so when you play some of these 4k, 3d multiplayer games where every millisecond counts, that means all of your resources are getting maxed out, fans are blowing full throttle, that keyboard is basically melting down, and noise from those fans are cutting into your gaming experience.  and since everything&rsquo;s moving at full throttle, you&rsquo;ll need to be plugged in, battery life is too risky if you&rsquo;re in a battle royale game striving for the top placement.  gaming on laptops is just not worth it.  there are cases where people have fixed their laptops and use it almost like a desktop, portability is not a requirement, but you might as well get a desktop, they have more power, better cooling, are cheaper, much more expandable, and you can attach a much better monitor to those.</p>

<p>the latest laptop spec&rsquo;d gpu&rsquo;s from nvidia are gtx 3090, but these are not the same as the ones you get for desktops, they&rsquo;re underclocked to keep the thermal limits feasible on laptops with poor cooling and underwhelming power.  so why bother?</p>

<p>you&rsquo;d think that for graphics cards, these things have been around since the 90s (diamond stealth 3d voodoo anyone?), you&rsquo;d think they&rsquo;d have plateaued kind of like cpu&rsquo;s where you could get by with a middle of the road processor for most tasks like email, web browsing, and video, i mean 4k video seems to run fine on my arm processor for my mobile phone, but gaming, oh man gaming, is a much different story, we are still at the pinnacle, every bit of juice is being squeezed out of modern hardware as games become more immersive, much more realistic, and have more and more people in worlds playing together.</p>

<p>so i didn&rsquo;t plop down and spend a fortune by going for msi, alienware, asus, or razer laptops with nvidia gtx 3080 gpus, it just didn&rsquo;t make much sense.  instead, i went for a thinkpad x13 with a ryzen processor and built in radeon apu.  i don&rsquo;t really play games on this machine, i mean i&rsquo;ve tried, but the laptop basically feels like it&rsquo;s on the verge of melting, the fans get loud, and even still, i cannot squeeze out top settings on the games i like to play (you can toggle the superiority of the graphics to leverage lesser hardware i.e. lower the graphic detail to keep gameplay crisp), but why would you do that, it really defeats the purpose.  so desktops, diy, and windows are still kings of pc gaming.  if you&rsquo;re smart you&rsquo;ll buy a console which has the same components as a modern day pc, but costs a fraction of the price, and you can attach the same peripherals like keyboards and mice.</p>

<p>but ultimately i feel like the gpu companies are going in the same direction as the pentium 4 era, just max out power and frequency to get the fastest performance at the expense of wasting power.  intel and amd got smarter and stopped with all the moore&rsquo;s law non-sense and came up with the idea that what we really should be innovating on is more throughput utilizing less power.  when will the gpu company&rsquo;s ever learn from history&rsquo;s mistakes?  by the time nvidia comes out with the gtx 4090, you&rsquo;ll probably need a mini transformer in your house to power that thing.</p>

<p>but where there are challenges there are opportunities for disruption.  think of a laptop that you can use for immersive game play, but at a lower power envelope, that would be a game changer.  don&rsquo;t tell me about nintendo switch either, if you think switch graphics are superior, you need to update your glasses.  and these streaming game services where you use a thin client to talk to a cloud server, that technology&rsquo;s not good enough for that millisecond processing needed by realtime games, at least it doesn&rsquo;t appear cheap enough and optimized enough for massive adoption.</p>

<p>microsoft has been on a resurgence lately, not just from a stock perspective, but also from a mindshare perspective, the company has been growing quickly in terms of its overall business (traditional software, azure cloud, gaming, etc), people are starting to believe in microsoft as a leading innovator especially since that monkey ballmer left.  and for a long time you didn&rsquo;t hear about any issues with their windows operating system as windows 10 has been a seeming success, could be that the earlier versions of windows 10 had issues, but i only started using windows 10 recently.  however, windows 10 certainly can&rsquo;t be comparable to the windows vista days, that was one of microsoft&rsquo;s biggest disasters.  but low and behold, microsoft has regained its footing as kings of incompetence with their latest operating system, windows 11!  in very odd fashion, windows 11 was rolled out to limited users, first it came bundled with new hardware and only a limited number people with old hardware were able to update, i assume they were shaking out the bugs and didn&rsquo;t want it to impact too many people hence the slow roll out, it&rsquo;s probably like the equivalent of an alpha launch.  this all started back in october last year, at that time it wasn&rsquo;t made available to me, but just recently i was added to the list and my laptop met the requirements for install so i upgraded.  windows 11 has very strict requirements for tpm and secure boot, without this, you will not be able to install.  my desktop had this issue and i&rsquo;m still not sure if i need to re-install from scratch or that an update is possible.</p>

<p>however, after using windows 11 for a few days, i have found that it is completely unstable, i performed an update instead of a clean install, and here are some of the issues that i&rsquo;ve had to deal with: docker being unable to start, wireguard getting in a non-stop spin trying to activate a connection, finger print reader not reading (this happens consistently after the first successful read, all subsequent reads fail), windows installer locking up, virtual box locking up, overheating while the lid is closed and in sleep mode, there have been several instances where i wasn&rsquo;t even able to bring up the task manager to kill chrome browser and if i could bring up the task manager, end task would have absolutely no response, the only way to resolve the issue was to reboot the machine, but the reboot sometimes gets stalled where i needed to hard power off the machine, this has been a total nightmare and makes windows 11 totally unusable.  i have kept all drivers, bios/firmware, and patches up to date, i would strongly suggest not installing windows 11 at this point in time, don&rsquo;t kid yourself, it takes me back to the days of windows 95 where if you&rsquo;re heavily using your computer, you&rsquo;d need to reboot multiple times a day to make the basics work.  this is completely unacceptable even if windows 11 is a free upgrade.  i am more afraid of rolling back to windows 10, so i&rsquo;ll keep windows 11 for now, but this has been a productivity nightmare.  seems that the infallible satya is not really capable of pulling microsoft out of the broken software mire, have you no shame man?  this shows direct incompetence even if azure is blowing the roof off in terms of revenue!  and for the record, i&rsquo;m an investor in microsoft.  what i&rsquo;ve decided to do is install ubuntu 20.04 lts desktop as a dual boot option, if it proves worthy, i may even just do a clean install with ubuntu alone, but i feel bad not having recouped my costs for a windows 10 license (this you still have to pay for).</p>

<p>honestly, when rafael nadal started playing tennis, i really wasn&rsquo;t a fan of his, it wasn&rsquo;t that i hated watching him play or his looks, i guess he didn&rsquo;t really have any extraordinary skills it seemed at the time, he came out of clay courts, like many other spanish players and played as a counter puncher which is also quite typical of clay court specialists, not very fun to watch in my humble opinion, baseline rallies would easily go 20-30 strokes a point, it seemed the point was just to hit the ball back and force the other player to make a mistake as opposed to hitting clean winners.  there were other spanish players of note that excelled on clay courts, i&rsquo;m looking at you sergei bruguera and albert costa, but couldn&rsquo;t win a thing on the faster surfaces like hard and grass courts.  later on nadal would prove that he wasn&rsquo;t just a clay courts specialist, he would win on all other surfaces and consistently beat the top players.  what&rsquo;s not to like about someone who plays with guts, never gives up on a point, runs down almost every ball?  rafael was always very athletic, had both endurance and bursty speed, and i don&rsquo;t think any other tennis player can compare in terms of biceps size.  but he seemed a little bit different from your ideal tennis player with the long hair, doorags, tank tops, flashy colors, fiery attitude, unconventional strokes, wicked left handed spin, he wasn&rsquo;t your stereotypical tennis player of any time really.  honestly, his whirling forehand almost seems reminiscent of those spanish bull fighters whirling their capes away from charging bulls, the follow through literally goes over his head and whips at the end to the back of the head!</p>

<p>i had to think on this for a long time, on why i wasn&rsquo;t a rafa guy, and i came to the conclusion that the main factor was probably roger federer, how could you like anyone but federer?  federer was this clean cut swiss with precision like a surgeon, he would disect opponents and break them down with ease, his all court style of tennis was like reading poetry when watching him, serve and volley, baseline rallies, he had it all.  but still, nadal took federer on many surfaces, wimbledon, us and australian opens, and of course trounced federer on clay.</p>

<p>but over time, i have grown to really like nadal and appreciate his accomplishments, even though he is probably one of the most unconventional players even more so than andre agassi (don&rsquo;t get me started with that crucifix earing on his left ear, goatee, and literally flaming compression shorts), but nadal&rsquo;s tenacity and spirit, even at age 36, after getting coronavirus and having foot surgery only a few months before the australian open, was able to overcome 5 and half hours of play against an up and coming 26 year old star to win his 21st grand slam tournament which is more than djokovic and federer, that makes rafa truly the goat, the greatest of all time.  on top of that he had to also overcome several major surgeries over his career, for some time you&rsquo;d only hear about federer and djokovic finals, there was no mention of nadal, but he hung in there and he made his comeback.  and if you watched today&rsquo;s championship game you&rsquo;d see that rafa had added many things to his arsenal, he&rsquo;s no longer the same counter-puncher from his early years, he hits winners with his forehand and backhand quite frequently, he comes to the net to volley, he&rsquo;s a more all around player, but most importantly, he&rsquo;s still got the guts from years ago that lets him fight through all the adversity.</p>

<p>i appreciate this about him and he manages to do this like any other normal guy, going to work everyday, putting in his time, match after match, stroke after stroke, just a really humble chap.  so with that, my congratulations to the champion of champions, rafael nadal you are the goat of tennis!</p>
